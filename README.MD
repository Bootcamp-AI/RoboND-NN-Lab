We've prepared a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of creating a single layer neural network in TensorFlow.

## Instructions

####
Make sure you have followed the instructions in the classroom to setup your environment.

#### Run the Notebook
Run the following commands from the same directory as the commands above.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Bootcamp-AI/RoboND-NN-Lab.git
$ activate RoboND
$ jupyter notebook
```
The above will open the jupyter interface in your browser from where you can access the Lab folder and the jupyter notebook `NN_lab.ipynb`

#### Neural Networks Lab
The notebook has 3 problems for you to solve:
 - Problem 1: Normalize the features
 - Problem 2: Use TensorFlow operations to create features, labels, weight, and biases tensors
 - Problem 3: Tune the learning rate, number of steps, and batch size for the best accuracy
